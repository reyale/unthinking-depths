// xoshiro256** — fast, high-quality 64-bit PRNG.
// One instance per match, seeded from the match seed. All draws MUST happen
// in a fixed, deterministic order (combat: ascending unit-id). draw_count()
// is included in the state hash so any ordering violation is detectable.
//
// Why not std::mt19937_64?
// The engine type (std::mt19937_64) is fully specified by the standard and
// would be deterministic. The problem is std::uniform_int_distribution: the
// standard does not mandate an algorithm for it, so the same seed produces
// different sequences across libstdc++, libc++, and MSVC. We would still need
// a hand-rolled bounded-draw function regardless. xoshiro256** is also ~2.5x
// faster than MT19937 and uses 32 bytes of state vs 2.5 KB.
