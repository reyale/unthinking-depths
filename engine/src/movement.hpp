// micro-steps. Each step is resolved simultaneously:
//   - Contested tile: higher collision priority wins; ties → lower unit-id.
//   - Swap (A↔B): both blocked.
//   - Blocked unit: stays put, no retry.
//   - MoveAttack: unit halts as soon as an enemy is within attack range.
// Units with Attack/Idle/other commands do not move.
